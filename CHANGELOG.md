# 2.0.0

The Terraform VSCode extension has [a new home at HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/supporting-the-hashicorp-terraform-extension-for-visual-studio-code/)! We're integrating with a [new language server](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls) designed to create a stable integration with Terraform through public APIs. When you upgrade to v2.0.0, the new language server will be installed by default, and checking for updates automatically.

Two commands have been added to manage the language server manually, which you can access via the [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette): "Terraform: Install/Update Language Server" and "Terraform: Enable/Disable Language Server".

If you want to use a custom-built language server, it can be enabled with the Terraform extension setting "terraform.languageServer.pathToBinary". Include the full path and binary name.

In this version, we've updated the syntax highlighting to work under Terraform 0.12. Errors that were seen in trying to read 0.12 files have also been eliminated. Highlighting and other core features will be partially compatible under 0.11 as well but continuing development will only focus on 0.12 and future versions. If you work in 0.11, you should [pin your extension to an earlier version](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_30#_install-previous-versions).

Other updates:

* Full-document formatting is provided through the language server and [can be configured](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_formatting) through user or workspace settings
* Added shortcuts (snippets) for variable and for_each syntax -- `fore`, `vare`, `varm`
* For contributors, the TypeScript testing and linting frameworks have been brought current with the recommended packages
* Logos now match the current brand guidelines (pretty snazzy!)
* Auto-completion, hover, and definition features are now managed by the language server, so see their [changelog](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for the most recent updates
* External commands such as `terraform validate` and `tflint` are removed from the extension, but we plan to add hooks for these and/or additional integrations via the language server.
* The outline view and model overview have been removed for now in order to focus on core features

# 1.4.0

Thanks to [@lawrencegripper](https://github.com/lawrencegripper) and [@juliosueiras](https://github.com/juliosueiras) we now have the first release in place which supports Terraform 0.12 using a new and shiny language server. In order to start using the language server you need to change the configuration to enable it or run the command `Terraform: Enable/Disable Language Server` or set `terraform.languageServer.enabled` to `true`.

## New Features

- Terraform 0.12 support ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ†ðŸŽ‰

# 1.3.12

Sadly, I am currently very busy with my work so I cannot dedicate anytime to this project, however I am very lucky to have enthuastic users who have stepped up and started to fix small issues and add some features.

Terraform 0.12 support is still not available, but some progress is being made in issue [Issue 157](https://github.com/mauve/vscode-terraform/issues/157) if you want to see this support land, I would kindly ask you to get involved with the users in that ticket.

## Fixes

- Catches exceptions in all commands and providers and reports them automatically (if enabled, closes [#106](https://github.com/mauve/vscode-terraform/issues/106))

## Format On Auto-Save Removal

In one of the very first versions of the Terraform plugin, that is before VSCode had format-on-save
or the auto-save features, the Terraform plugin had its own implementation of format-on-save which
just listened to save events from the editor and then overwrite the files.

Later auto-save was introduced and because the Terraform plugin was listening to save events and
manually performing format on save, that meant that without doing anything we suddenly had
format-on-auto-save.

A while back VSCode introduced a proper API for performing formatting and formatting on save; these
APIs have been in use by the extension since 0.0.20; when these API were introduced they deliberatively
omitted format on auto save, because it breaks development workflows in more complicated languages.

Now the Terraform plugin has started to become relatively complicated in itself with auto completion
support and refactoring support as well as more and more coding features added all the time. As the
usage of the extension has been growing and we have started to see more and more bugs because we
perform format-on-auto-save.

So now I had to remove the feature.

Sorry to all of you who liked the feature. I hope you will keep using my extension regardless of the lack of this feature.

With the removal of this feature the following configuration changes have been made.

1. the Terraform extension no longer supply a default config for `[terraform]editor.formatOnSave: false`, instead
   the default setting of `editor.formatOnSave` applies unless you have overridden it yourself.
1. the setting `terraform.format.enable` is now gone as it doesn't make sense anymore
1. the setting `terraform.formatOnSave` is now gone as it has no effect
   - use `editor.formatOnSave` or `[terraform]editor.formatOnSave` instead

Thanks for using my extension.

# 1.1.2 (post-humously documented)

## Fixes & Changes

- Literally nothing

# 1.1.1

## Fixes

- Correctly track user session

# 1.1.0

## Features

- Very simple telemetry is now being reported if enabled (currently only an event is recorded when the plugin activates)

## Fixes

- Indexing is now done per workspace folder rather than globally (closes #83)
- HIL parse errors are now correctly handled and surfaced in the *Problems* view

## Telemetry

Currently only a simple `activated` event is being recorded. All events include the version of VSCode and
some other automatically provided properties by VSCode (refer: [Common Properties](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-telemetry#common-properties)).

The plugin respects the global telemetry opt-out (`telemetry.enableTelemetry`) setting but you can also
disable telemetry collection for just this plugin by setting `terraform.telemetry.enabled` to `false`.

You can read more about telemetry reporting in VSCode in the [FAQ](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/supporting/FAQ#_how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting).

### Format on save

The last version introduced usage of the correct extension APIs for registering formatting
providers. VSCode then automatically invokes the formatting provider on save if `editor.formatOnSave` has been specified. VSCode however does never invoke the formatting
provider if the save operation came from an auto-save event.

0.0.21 reintroduces the manual code which handled format on autosave instead of relying on
VSCode to perform those operations. The following configuration options have changes as result
of that:

- `terraform.format.enable`: needs to be `true`
- `terraform.format.formatOnSave`: needs to be `true`
- `terraform.format.ignoreExtensionsOnSave`: can be used to exclude `.tfvars` for example from autosave formatting

The global setting: `editor.formatOnSave` should be `false` for Terraform files and the
extension contributes that default configuration. Please verify that you do not have
conflicting configuration, by removing the following setting if you have it:

```json
"[terraform]": {
  "editor.formatOnSave": true
}
```

The configuration `editor.formatOnSave` will have the correct setting contributed by Terraform.

- The introduced formatter changes means that the plugin specific configuration for formatting (e.g. `terraform.formatOnSave`) have been deprecated and are no longer used.
