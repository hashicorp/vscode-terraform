## Release History

**v2.0.0**  is the first official release from HashiCorp, prior releases were by [Mikael Olenfalk](https://github.com/mauve).

The 2.0.0 release integrates a new [Language Server package from HashiCorp](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls). The extension will install and upgrade terraform-ls to continue to add new functionality around code completion and formatting. See the [terraform-ls CHANGELOG](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for details.

In addition, this new version brings the syntax highlighting up to date with all HCL2 features, as needed for Terraform 0.12 and above.

See the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-vscode-extension-internal/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for more information.

If you are using a Terraform version prior to 0.12.0, you should [pin to earlier versions](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_30#_install-previous-versions) of this extension prior to v2.0.0.
