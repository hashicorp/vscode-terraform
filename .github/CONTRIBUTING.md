## Releasing

Releases are made on a reasonably regular basis by the maintainers (HashiCorp staff), using our internal tooling. The following notes are only relevant to maintainers.

Release Process:

1. Create a release branch/PR with the following changes:

   - Bump the language server version in `package.json` if the release should include a LS update
   - Update the [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) with the recent changes
   - Bump the version in `package.json` (and `package-lock.json`) by using `npm version 2.X.Y`

1. Review & merge the branch and wait for the [Test Workflow](https://github.com/hashicorp/vscode-terraform/actions/workflows/test.yml) on `main` to complete
1. Run the [Deploy Workflow](https://github.com/hashicorp/vscode-terraform/actions/workflows/deploy.yml) from `main` for a `stable` release
1. Wait for publishing & processing to complete
1. Create a new release & tag on GitHub for the version `v2.X.Y` and copy over the changelog
1. Optional: Wait ~10 minutes and run the [Deploy Workflow](https://github.com/hashicorp/vscode-terraform/actions/workflows/deploy.yml) from `main` for a `prerelease` release to also update the preview extension
