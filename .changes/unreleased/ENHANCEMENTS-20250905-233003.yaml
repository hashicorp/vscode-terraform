kind: ENHANCEMENTS
body: Improve Terraform Configuration for MCP Server using resolveMcpServerDefinition. The documentation states that user interactions should happen in the resolveMcpServerDefinition function, so the Docker check is moved over here. The check just sees if the docker info command works. If it fails, it means Docker isn't installed or isn't running.
