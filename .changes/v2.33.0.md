## 2.33.0 (2024-10-14)

NOTES:

This release adds support for Terraform Stack and Deployment files. This provides intelligent completion for Terraform Stacks blocks and attributes in Stack and Deployment files, including suggesting only valid completions for variables in component and deployment blocks. Hover documentation for all Stack and Deploy blocks, with helpful type and usage information. Early Validation has been extended to produce diagnostics along with syntax validation for Stack and Deployment files. Reference support allows code navigation in and between Stack and Deploy files. This also provides formatting support for both Stack and Deploy files.

This release also adds support for Terraform Test and Mock files. This provides syntax highlighting, completion for blocks and attributes, hover documentation and formatting support.
