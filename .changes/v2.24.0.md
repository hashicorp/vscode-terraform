ENHANCEMENTS:

 - Use dark extension icon for preview extension ([#1143](https://github.com/hashicorp/vscode-terraform/pull/1143))
 - Introduce support for extension connecting to LSP over TCP, with port configurable via `terraform.languageServer.tcp.port` ([#755](https://github.com/hashicorp/vscode-terraform/pull/755))
 - New Terraform View side bar ([#1171](https://github.com/hashicorp/vscode-terraform/pull/1171))
 - Only show language server related commands when they're relevant ([#1178](https://github.com/hashicorp/vscode-terraform/pull/1178))
 - Replace internal watcher (used for watching changes in installed plugins and modules) with LSP dynamic capability registration & `workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles`. This should lead to improved performance in most cases. ([terraform-ls#953](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls/pull/953))
 - Provide completion, hover and docs links for uninitialized Registry modules ([terraform-ls#924](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls/pull/924))
 - Provide basic IntelliSense (except for diagnostics) for hidden `*.tf` files ([terraform-ls#971](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls/pull/971))
 - Introduce v1.1 `terraform` `cloud` block ([terraform-schema#117](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-schema/pull/117))
 - Introduce v1.1 `moved` block ([terraform-schema#121](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-schema/pull/121))
 - Introduce v1.2 `lifecycle` conditions ([terraform-schema#115](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-schema/pull/115))
 - Introduce v1.2 `lifecycle` `replace_triggered_by` ([terraform-schema#123](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-schema/pull/123))
 - Use `module` declarations from parsed configuration as source of truth for `module.calls` ([terraform-ls#987](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls/pull/987))
 - Index uninitialized modules ([terraform-ls#997](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls/pull/997))
 - Recognize inputs and outputs of uninitialized local modules ([terraform-ls#598](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls/issues/598))
 - Enable go to module output declaration from reference ([terraform-ls#1007](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls/issues/1007))
 - New option [`indexing.ignorePaths`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls/blob/v0.29.0/docs/SETTINGS.md#ignorepaths-string) was introduced ([terraform-ls#1003](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls/pull/1003), [terraform-ls#1010](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls/pull/1010))
 - Introduce `module.terraform` custom LSP command to expose Terraform requirements & version ([terraform-ls#1016](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls/pull/1016))
 - Avoid obtaining schema via Terraform CLI if the same version is already cached (based on plugin lock file) ([terraform-ls#1014](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls/pull/1014))
 - Complete module source and version attributes for local and registry modules ([#1024](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls/pull/1024))

BUG FIXES:

 - Ensure extension is installed in remote contexts automatically ([#1163](https://github.com/hashicorp/vscode-terraform/pull/1163))
 - Return partially parsed metadata from `module.providers` ([terraform-ls#951](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls/pull/951))
 - Avoid ignoring hidden `*.tfvars` files ([terraform-ls#968](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls/pull/968))
 - Avoid crash on invalid URIs ([terraform-ls#969](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls/pull/969))
 - Avoid crash on invalid provider name ([terraform-ls#1030](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls/pull/1030))

INTERNAL:

 - Refactor Terraform Execution API [#1185](https://github.com/hashicorp/vscode-terraform/pull/1185))
